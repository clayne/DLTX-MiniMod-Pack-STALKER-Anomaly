<text> Yes, I got something, came in just this morning. A new group of researchers has arrived in the Zone, collecting strange artifacts. Well, not really artifatcs, more like irraditated junk, but for some reason they are interesed in it. They might need a hand. </text>

 <text> Hello Professor, may I ask how  your research is going? </text>
 </string>  
 <string id = "meet_ah_1">
<text> Of course! I am always happy to share our progress. Currently, our research team is working on a theory about the origin of artifacts. My colleagues and I planned an excursion into the zone and split up to cover as much ground as possible. However, I do have this matter I need some help with... </text>

<text> For my next experiment, I require anomalous dirt from the local anomalous fields. You need to go into these anomalies and find these almost-formed artifacts. Your detector should be able to pick them up to help you search. </text>

 </string>
 <string id = "meet_ah_8">
 <text> Well, I suppose I can give you my old detector. It's an old model, but it should do the trick. If you do a couple of these jobs for us, you will be able to buy a better one in no time! Check your PDA for the locations I am interesed in for now. </text>

<text> You see, previously, I measured the anomalies at Agroprom and found a number of strange abnormalities. Artifacts that form in these anomalies have unique modulation characteristics on the noosphere. However, during my studies, we got attacked. The situation got quite tense and we had to flee. In the confusion, I left my laptop with the scan data at one of the anomaly sites. If you can, please find my laptop, it will show the coordinates of the anomalies I scanned. Look for any anomalous samples you can find in them. </text>

 <text> Anything else you need help with, professor? </text>

 <string id = "markov_2_quest_3">
<text> Ah, yes! While I was out on a field study, I found strange fluctuations in the noosphere in the neighboring area called the Wild Territory. They seem to have some sort of influence on the artifacts that form there, so I want you to go and investigate. I'll give you the coordinates of the places I am interested in. </text>
 </string>

 <string id = "markov_2_quest_end_0">

 </string>
    <string id = "markov_3_quest_3">
<text> Hmm, let me see.. Ah yes! There is another field study I did not manage to carry out yet. Just up north of here in Yantar, there is the an old labratory which emits dangerously high levels of psy emissions. I have reason to believe these emissions are affecting the formation of artifacts in the area. I didn't mean to entrust you with this task, but I can't wait to see the results! You should talk to Professor Sakharov if you need some sort of psy protection. </text>
 </string>
    
 <string id = "markov_3_quest_end_0">
 <text> Man, this really wasn't easy, but I think I found them all. </text>
 </string>
 <string id = "markov_3_quest_end_1">
 <text> Amazing! Thank you, you have helped me a great deal, but this is all for now. If you want to help us further, then I have a colleague in the Swamps, that would appreciate your help. Last I heard from him, he set up camp in the abandoned church. I'll send you to him and let him know your coming. Farewell stalker! </text>

 <text> Woah, calm down man. Maybe I could help you. What do you need? </text>
 </string> 
 <string id = "pirogov_1_quest_5">
<text> Alright, listen. There are some pretty rare anomalies around here and they are practically untouched by these idiotic bandits. If you could get me a sample from each of them, I would be very grateful. Here are the coordinates. </text>
 </string>  

 <string id = "pirogov_1_quest_end_0">
 <text> That was one hell of a trip, but I managed to get your samples. </text>
 </string>
 <string id = "pirogov_1_quest_end_1">

    <string id = "pirogov_2_quest_0">
 <text> Anything else? </text>
 </string>
 <string id = "pirogov_2_quest_3">
<text> Unfortunately, yes. Sakharov just told me, that he wants me to check out the Truck Cemetery. You see, the Truck Cemetery is a poorly area, and many shun it for good reason, although there are a number of interesting anomalies. If you get me samples from these anomalies, I'll give you a 50% cut of the payment for this job. The area is just north of here, but watch out for the bandits.   </text>
 </string> 

 <string id = "pirogov_2_quest_end_0">
 <text> Man, what a desolate place that was. Anyway, here is your next batch, professor. </text>

 <text> So, anything else or was that it? </text>
 </string>
 <string id = "pirogov_3_quest_3">
<text> Well, there is one more thing. I sent my last assistant to the Garbage to place prototypes in some of the anomalies. But he has missed the last two radio contacts and I'm afraid something happened to him. </text>
 </string> 
    <string id = "pirogov_3_quest_4">
 <text> That's not surprising in this irradiated shithole. </text>
 </string>
        <string id = "pirogov_3_quest_5">
<text> Last time I heard of him he wanted to stock up at the Flea Market, so it's a good idea to start you search there. Find my assistant and his PDA, it should contain the locations of the remaining anomalies I am interested in. Bring me the samples please, so I can leave this godforsaken place. </text>
 </string>

 <string id = "pirogov_3_quest_end_0">
 <text> I found your assistant. Seems he got attacked by bandits and turned into swiss cheese, but I managed to recover his PDA and finish the job. Here you go, professor. </text>
 </string>
 <string id = "pirogov_3_quest_end_1">
 <text> What a shame, he was a good man. What a rotten way to die... Anyway, here is your reward. That's all for now, however, you might want to look for my colleagues. They probably have more work for you. I'll give you there contact, so you can find them. </text>

 <text> Aren't you an eager one? I hope you're not trying to plagiarize my work. </text>
 </string>
 <string id = "chernov_1_quest_2">
 <text> Not at all, professor. For now, all I am interested in is money. </text>
 </string> 
 <string id = "chernov_1_quest_5">
<text> Very well. Let's see if you have what it takes then, shall we? In this area, which the locals call the Army Warehouses, there are many interesting anomalies that most stalkers simply try to avoid. Get me samples from the ones I marked on your PDA and then we can talk further. </text>
 </string>  

 <string id = "chernov_1_quest_end_0">
 <text> Here we go, one batch of shiny dirt. </text>
 </string>
 <string id = "chernov_1_quest_end_1">
 <text> Great. As promised, here's your payment. Now, is there anything you want to know in particular?  </text>
 </string>          
 
    <string id = "chernov_3_quest_0">
 <text> I wondered how you even know where these strange artifacts will appear. </text>
 </string>
    <string id = "chernov_3_quest_1">
<text> Well, our research group is actually part of the SIRCAA, the Scientific Insititue for Research of the Chernobyl Anomalous Area. We are continously studying the zone to find a way to destroy it, or at the very least control it. We learned a lot thanks to the information provided by local stalkers and our own excursions. We even have preliminary anomaly maps for some areas. Using that information, and the data from our scanners,  we can deduce the likelihood of artifacts forming. </text>
 </string>      
    <string id = "chernov_3_quest_2">
 <text> Interesting. So that's how you know where to send me all the time. </text>
 </string>
        <string id = "chernov_3_quest_3">
<text> Precisely. However, your next task will require caution. I don't want you to get killed after all, you seem to be a good assistant so far. I tasked a particular stalker with investigating some anomalous fields in the Red Forest. Unfortunately, he seemed to have gone missing. The last location he messaged me from was one of the old mine tunnels. Go and find his PDA, which contains the scan data I gave him, and find the remaining samples. I must warn you however, I have lost many friends and colleagues to the Red Forest, so please be careful. </text>
 </string>
    
 <string id = "chernov_3_quest_end_0">
 <text> What a trip that was! Even though I had to shoot my way through, I managed to get all of the samples. This better be worth it, professor! </text>
 </string>
 <string id = "chernov_3_quest_end_1">
 <text> Wonderful, I was getting worried already. I hope this bonus will cover your medical expenses. </text>
 </string>  
    
    <string id = "chernov_4_quest_0">
 <text> So, did you ever manage to create artifacts in a lab? I mean, you have been studying them for quite some time now and wouldn't the need for the Zone fall dramatically, if artifacts could be created outside of it? </text>
 </string>
    <string id = "chernov_4_quest_1">
<text> Work on the creation of artificial artifacts was carried out even before the nuclear disaster and the creation of the zone. My supervisor used to live and work in Limansk. We stayed up at his house for many nights, discussing the possible origins of artifacts. After stealing a grow bed from the lab, we even managed to create a Proto-Artifact, just like the ones you brought me. </text>
 </string>      
    <string id = "chernov_4_quest_2">
 <text> Interesting. What happened to your friend? </text>
 </string>
        <string id = "chernov_4_quest_3">
<text> I don't know, there was no evacuation from Limansk at the time of the disaster. Where all its inhabitants disappeared to, is a mystery to me. That reminds me, I still have the address of his house. Could you go there and see, if the artifact is still there? Who knows, maybe it is the key to understanding all of this. </text>
 </string>  

 <string id = "chernov_4_quest_end_0">
<text> Limansk is in a terrible state. I found no survivors, except a bunch of crazy fanatics. I managed to find the artifact, however. Here it is. </text>
 </string>
 <string id = "chernov_4_quest_end_1">
 <text> I was expecting as much. Still, I can't help but miss my old friend... Anyway, let's honor his sacrifice and try to find out, how to stop all of this from happening again. </text>
 </string>      
    
    <string id = "chernov_5_quest_0">
 <text> How is it going, prof? Any news on the origin of artifacts? </text>
 </string>
    <string id = "chernov_5_quest_1">
<text> Yes, take a look here. Do you see this? This artifact has a completely unique emission pattern. My friend, right here, we have indisputable proof that artifacts can be obtained by artificial means. </text>
 </string>      
    <string id = "chernov_5_quest_2">
 <text> That's crazy! Wait, do you think, it is possible, that artifacts could have appeared before the Zone did? </text>
 </string>
        <string id = "chernov_5_quest_3">
<text> Well, I guess I can tell you, since you will find out eventually anyway. Ever heard of artifact farms? Research in this direction has been going on for a long time and the now abandoned X-19 laboratory was heavily invested in them. They created pods, which they called "beds", in which artifacts could form under controlled conditions. Nowadys, the area is overrun by fanatics, which call themselves Monolith, and is extremly dangerous. However, if you somehow manage to get in there and find any leftover artifacts or documentation, I will be in your debt.  </text>
 </string>

 <string id = "chernov_5_quest_end_0">
<text> Wow, you really didn't lie, the area was swarmed with Monolith, however I managed to get into the lab. Believe it or not, but you were right. I found an artifical artifact and some papers that looked important. Here you go.  </text>
 </string>
 <string id = "chernov_5_quest_end_1">
<text> Great. Don't ask how I knew it would be there, you wouldn't like the asnwer. Considering the nature of our research, I must ask for your discretion. I will reveal to the world eventually, what happened here. But before I can do that, I need to complete my theory on these artifacts. </text>
 </string>  
    
    <string id = "chernov_6_quest_0">
 <text> I understand. Is there anything else you need, professor? </text>
 </string>
    <string id = "chernov_6_quest_3">
<text> Yes, following up on our latest scans of the area, we found something interesting. A large group of mercenaries controls an area, which they call the Dead City. I got very stable readings from that area, so it will be great to use as a control. If you can bring me samples from these locations, I'll be able to create a baseline reading from them. </text>
 </string>  

 <string id = "chernov_6_quest_end_0">
 <text> Huh, the city didn't seem that "dead" to me. Here are the samples, prof. </text>
 </string>
 <string id = "chernov_6_quest_end_1">
 <text> Splendid work, here is your bonus. With how much you helped me, I might aswell mention you in the preface of my thesis. Altough you do not look like you care much about that - yet. If you want more work, you might want to look for some of my colleagues, here in the Zone. Maybe they will have something for you. I'll send you to them. </text>

 <text> Hello, I was told you might have some work for me. </text>
 </string>
    <string id = "juk_1_quest_3">
<text> I do, actually. There are a few anomalous fields I want to study, however for the moment I am stuck here and cannot leave the area. I will mark the anomalies I am interested in on your PDA. I hope you know what to do, Sakharov will be pissed if I don't find anything. </text>
 </string>

 <string id = "juk_1_quest_end_0">
 <text> Here you go. These are the artifacts I could find. </text>
 </string>

    <string id = "juk_2_quest_0">
 <text> Is there anything else I can help you with? </text>
 </string>
    <string id = "juk_2_quest_3">
<text> Yes, while you were out on the field, I received a new batch of scan data. As you might know, the Zone keeps a lot of mysteries from us and many anomalies have not been mapped yet. I will send you this preliminary scan data, as it includes the approximate location of some unmapped anomalies. Please confirm, if the data is right, and keep an eye out for any artifacts. But be careful, please - there is bound to be some error in the location data. </text>
 </string>  
    
 <string id = "juk_2_quest_end_0">
 <text> Man, I almost all out of bolts, but your data seemed correct, professor. I also managed to find some artifacts that you might want to have a look at. </text>
 </string>
 <string id = "juk_2_quest_end_1">
 <text> Great, at least our scanners are working fine then. Thank you for your report, the money should be with you shortly. </text>

    <string id = "juk_3_quest_0">
 <text> You seem like you have something on your mind. </text>
 </string>
    <string id = "juk_3_quest_3">
<text> Yeah, well, I do. You see, there are these extremely interesting emission patterns in Pripyat. However, as you may know, the city is just as dangerous as it is interesting and I don't think I have any hopes of making it in and out alive. If you can, please take a look at these locations and bring back any artifacts you can find back to me. Don't worry, the reward will more than cover your costs for ammo and bandages. </text>
 </string>      
    
 <string id = "juk_3_quest_end_0">
 <text> I think I still have a bullethole somewhere in my suit from those damn fanatics, but I managed to check out the anomalies you mentioned. I even found some samples for you. </text>
 </string>
 <string id = "juk_3_quest_end_1">
 <text> Phenomenal! Please take this, you earned it. That should be it for now. If you want to earn some more money collecting artifacts, you might want to search for some of my colleagues in the Zone. I'll let them know you're coming. </text>

 <text> What's up prof, need a hand in anything? </text>
 </string>
    <string id = "vorobushkin_1_quest_3">
<text> I might. Well, this area is poorly explored, so I don't fully know what to expect. However, my calculations predict that I should be able to find the artifacts I need here. Yesterday, in order to pinpoint the anomalous fields that need to be investigated, I repaired some of the equipment at the Krug Antenna Complex. However, the scan took quite long and it got more dangerous the longer I stayed there, so I had to return here in a hurry. You need to enter the station and pick up the memory module I left there. All the necessary data should be on it. By the way, there are several anomalies nearby, perhaps they contain the samples I need, but it will be impossible to say, before retrieving the scan data. </text>
 </string>      

 <string id = "vorobushkin_1_quest_end_0">
<text> Easy peasy, professor. Your equipment was still there, together with the data and I managed to get your samples. </text>

    <string id = "vorobushkin_2_quest_3">

 </string>  
 <string id = "vorobushkin_redirect_dialog_2">
<text> Thanks for the invaluable help. I still need to do some calculations. And you move to the north of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. The head of our group, Professor Skabinsky, is already there. I have no idea how he got through there, but please, hurry! He probably needs your help. </text>
 </string>  
 <string id = "vorobushkin_redirect_dialog_3">
<text> Our calculations are full of holes due to lack of sufficient information, but we were able to approximate the location of the anomaly, which we failed to predict previously.

So, here is the situation: I had a group of mercenaries escort me here, but most of them got shot already, so we gotta do this quick. Close to us is a dangerous anomaly, unlike any I have seen before. Some of our calculations predict that around this time, a very rare and powerful artifact should form. You have by far the most experience with anomalous fields out of all of us, so we need you to head in there and see if our predictions are correct. I must warn you however, it will be very dangerous. Are you up for it? </text>

Data on the enemies you will encounter: zombified, mutants, the expected number of 50-100.

        <text>We have some good news, have a seat. Crutch managed to find out that some of our missing comrades from 2011 survived! Judging by the information from the DA, a mercenary named Scar, who in 2011 was making his way with our assault squads through Limansk and Hospital to NCPP in order to catch up with him and stop the shooter survived, we also know that he was in contact with some stalkers, whose description is similar to the members of Lebedev's group. Our scout claims that the information is not false. Stalker, make inquiries about Scar from those who deal with neutrals and find him. Perhaps we can reunite with our comrades. The best thing would be to go straight to Sidorovitch.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="cs_task3_cold_dialog_2">
        <text>Yes, that's great news. Perhaps Sidorovich knows this stalker. I'll ask him and find surviving comrades.</text>

        <text>I found one surviving member of Clear Skies.</text>

        <text>You found him? Who is he? Where is he?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="holod_end_cs_story_2">
        <text>That's Gamayun, one of Lebedev's group. He's currently fighting with the Outcasts of the Monolith. Unfortunately, he refused to return to the Swamps with me. He says he won't leave his brothers behind.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="holod_end_cs_story_3">
        <text>Well, he knows better. If he survived, perhaps others did. Your story gives me hope. Perhaps one day we will be reunited with our comrades. Also, I will have our intelligence units assist the outcasts. Oh, yeah, I think you deserve a reward.</text>

        <text>That's the one. Who the hell are you? Not now, help me fight off a pack of pseudo-dogs. They've been chasing me for two kilometers.</text>

        <text>Oh, we did it. Please tell me about the surviving members of Lebedev's group. According to my information, you know something.</text>

    <string id="cs_task5_dragun_dialog_1">
        <text>Yes, I do know something. But I won't tell you much, I know only rumors. Have you heard about the Strider and his group? They are all former monoliths, but now they have rebelled against the masters of the Zone and are guerrilla warfare with the "Monolith". Rumor has it that among these monolith outcasts are members of Clear Sky. His unit is located in the vicinity of "Jupiter", in the former territory of the army checkpoint, there used to hang out the leader of a local gang of bandits, nicknamed Valet, until he was shot in the temple.</text>

        <text>Hmm... We do have CS'es in our ranks. They were monoliths like the rest of us, until the O-Consciousness loosened its grip. Now we stand together against the Monolith.</text>

        <text>I'm afraid you're too late. Their unit's gone on a mission to eastern Pripyat. Unfortunately, they haven't made contact yet. If you hurry, you can catch up with them. I don't have many men, so I don't have anyone to send to their rescue.</text>

        <text>I'm actually looking for you. You're a member of Lebedev's group, aren't you? "Clear Skies is looking for you.</text>

        <text>Hmm... I used to be. But now I'm an Outcast of the Monolith. I'll tell you everything and we'll decide what to do next, but now help me complete my task while you're here. The Monoliths were tougher than we thought. I've sent a unit to the river port to seize a device that can be used to bug fanatics, but they didn't respond. Seems like the Monolith captured them. Recon the territory and help us capture this device.</text>

        <text>Thank you, you'd better give it to the Strider. I'll stay here, and we'll secure this outpost with my boys.</text>

        <text>So you're not coming to the Swamp with me?</text>

    <string id="gamajun_cs_story_dialog2_3">
        <text>No. I'm sorry, but I'm an outcast. I can't leave my brothers behind. By the way, I promised you I'd tell you my story, so listen. In 2011, I was with Lebedev as part of an assault group breaking through Limansk. Our boss and some guys and some mercenaries moved further north, and I established myself in the city. Then there was that ejection, after which I lost my memory. According to Strider, I served the Monolith like all of them. After the events of 2012 I was myself again, waking up somewhere in the vicinity of Jupiter. I managed to survive thanks to Strider, and I became a member of his group.</text>

        <text>Thank you for your story. I'll pass the device on to Strider, and I'll say hello to Cold from you.</text>

        <text>Is there a special job?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="dolg_story_task_1_dialog_start_1">
        <text>Come to think of it, yes. There's a war going on with the Freedom and the bandits, plus there's fanatics coming from the north. All our forces are at war, and we need hunters for our main task - to destroy the Zone. I'm offering you a job as a witch doctor. It's as simple as that: I offer you a "witch" contract, and you fulfill it and get a reward for it. How's that sound?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="dolg_story_task_1_dialog_start_2">
        <text>Sounds good. If the pay is decent, I'll take it. What's my first contract?</text>

    <string id="dolg_story_task_1_dialog_start_3">
        <text>Don't worry about the pay, we'll pay you in money and good equipment if you prove yourself. Your first contract will be to destroy a den of bloodsuckers that have migrated south. It's a pretty big pain in the ass, the bloodsuckers have gotten past all our posts and patrols. Destroy these critters and come back for your reward. I suggest you start your search for the lair with the Butcher, he's the leader of the local hunters. </text>
    </string>
    <string id="dolg_story_task_1_dialog_start_4">
        <text>I'll take that contract. Consider these bloodsuckers already dead.</text>

        <text>Well, here's the thing... A box with a report from one of the expeditions that went north was handed over to the roadblock from deep in the Zone. During the day they guard it as if it were filled with pure plutonium, but at night for some reason leave no more than two guards. Sneak up to the roadblock and get that box for me. And I'll spare no expense to you... within reason. You'll do it, won't you ?</text>

He's a pretty generous guy, spent a lot of money. From what he told me, I understand he's looking for something on Zaton. I think that's where he is now. There's also a rumor that he's holed up in the substation shops, collecting some junk. All right, good luck finding him.</text>
