        <text>Here's the device.</text>

    <string id="gamajun_cs_story_dialog2_1">
        <text>Thank you, you'd better give it to the Strider. I'll stay here, and we'll secure this outpost with my boys.</text>

        <text>So you're not coming to the Swamp with me?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="gamajun_cs_story_dialog2_3">
        <text>No. I'm sorry, but I'm an outcast. I can't leave my brothers behind. By the way, I promised you I'd tell you my story, so listen. In 2011, I was with Lebedev as part of an assault group breaking through Limansk. Our boss and some guys and some mercenaries moved further north, and I established myself in the city. Then there was that ejection, after which I lost my memory. According to Strider, I served the Monolith like all of them. After the events of 2012 I was myself again, waking up somewhere in the vicinity of Jupiter. I managed to survive thanks to Strider, and I became a member of his group.</text>

    <string id="gamajun_cs_story_dialog2_4">
        <text>Thank you for your story. I'll pass the device on to Strider, and I'll say hello to Cold from you.</text>

        <text>Is there a special job?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="dolg_story_task_1_dialog_start_1">
        <text>Come to think of it, yes. There's a war going on with the Freedom and the bandits, plus there's fanatics coming from the north. All our forces are at war, and we need hunters for our main task - to destroy the Zone. I'm offering you a job as a witch doctor. It's as simple as that: I offer you a "witch" contract, and you fulfill it and get a reward for it. How's that sound?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="dolg_story_task_1_dialog_start_2">
        <text>Sounds good. If the pay is decent, I'll take it. What's my first contract?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="dolg_story_task_1_dialog_start_3">
        <text>Don't worry about the pay, we'll pay you in money and good equipment if you prove yourself. Your first contract will be to destroy a den of bloodsuckers that have migrated south. It's a pretty big pain in the ass, the bloodsuckers have gotten past all our posts and patrols. Destroy these critters and come back for your reward. I suggest you start your search for the lair with the Butcher, he's the leader of the local hunters. </text>
    </string>
    <string id="dolg_story_task_1_dialog_start_4">
        <text>I'll take that contract. Consider these bloodsuckers already dead.</text>

        <text>Mission accomplished, bloodsuckers destroyed.</text>

        <text>I'm looking for a certain mercenary named Scar. You know him?</text>

        <text>Maybe I do, but what do you need him for?</text>

        <text>He's got important information that's important to Clear Skies.</text>

    <string id="cs_task3_sidor_dialog_2">
        <text>I can sell you some information, but it'll cost you 20,000 bucks + some favors. Do some special assignment, as a sign that I can trust you, and we'll see what we know about Scar.</text>

    <string id="cs_task3_sidor_dialog_4">

        <text>Yeah, here's the money. I did my job.</text>

    <string id="cs_task3_sidor_dialog1_4">
        <text>Well, anyway, listen, or better yet, write it down on a piece of paper, heh-heh. This mercenary came to see me. He needed some equipment for a deep raid into the northern territories. He's a pretty generous guy, spent a lot of money. From what he told me, I understand he's looking for something on Zaton. I think that's where he is now. There's also a rumor that he's holed up in the substation shops, collecting some junk. All right, good luck finding him.</text>
