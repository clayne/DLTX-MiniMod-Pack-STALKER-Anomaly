Yastin's Dynamic Relation tweaks TEST VERSION; For Anomaly update 3.

Installation: Drop it in yo' Anomaly folder.

Changes:

v1;
- Factions do not lose relationship with anyone for the death of neutral (-1000 to 1000) factions any more. Now they become 'buddies' at 500+ relation, making the early stage of warfare slightly less volatile.
- Individual deaths are less meaningful/'valuable' in general. The zone's a dangerous place, shit happens.
- Certain factions are not allied with, but 'protected' by other factions. Killing these factions will incur a penalty with their protectors, but only works one way.
	Current Protection Relationships:
	Ecologists: Protected by Duty, Loners, Military (If you kill all the egghead, who will the everyman sell his shiny rocks to?)
	Loners: Protected by Duty (Duty tries to act as peacekeepers. They won't tolerate the continued slaughter of 'neutral' stalkers.)
	Duty: Protected by Military (Though not 'allies', the Military watches Duty's back whilst Duty can't afford to protect the military outright.)
-Factions with many enemies (Monolith, Sin, etc.) now give smaller boosts to relationships instead of none at all, whilst attacking more 'connected' factions will please their enemies more.
-Factions with many enemies will cause their (fewer) 'buddies' more distress when killed, while more 'connected' faction troops' deaths will cause their (more numerous) friends less grief.
