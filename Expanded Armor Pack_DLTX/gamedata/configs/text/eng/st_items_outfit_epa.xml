			<text>%c[ui_gray_1]An excellent protective suit for the Zone. This heavy military-grade armour is designed for major battle operations in anomalous areas.

This variant has been slightly modified to become lighter by sacrificing certain components used in its construction.\n \n

Consists of an integrated tactical helmet, a heavy armoured vest and a reinforced environmental jumpsuit. Often used by experts and legends in the zone, this radsuit has seen various upgrades and personal touches. \n \n
